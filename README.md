# packwiz Example Pack
This is an example pack, created to show the features of the packwiz format! You're welcome to install this and play around with it using the [packwiz tools](https://packwiz.infra.link/), but it's not intended as a template; use the `packwiz init` command to create your own pack.

You may want to copy a couple of files from this pack to use in your own (no permission or license required; this pack is licensed CC0), particularly `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore` and `.packwizignore`. (in the future `packwiz init` will likely generate what you need for these)

Contributions are welcomed, for improving the clarity of the repository to new users. Don't PR to add new mods, unless you're adding them to specifically demonstrate packwiz features - this isn't meant to be a playable pack. This pack is included as a submodule in the [pack format specification](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-spec), and has versioned branches corresponding with those of the spec.
